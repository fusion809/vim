# vim
This repository contains my vimrc file for Vim running on my Linux machines. The [`mock`](https://github.com/fusion809/vim/tree/mock) branch also contains packaging files for building a Vim RPM package for Fedora.

To install extra bundle(s) I like, run:

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/justmao945/vim-clang.git
```
