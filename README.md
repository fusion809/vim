# vim
This repository contains my `~/.vimrc` file for Vim running on my Linux machines. The [`mock`](https://github.com/fusion809/vim/tree/mock) branch also contains packaging files for building a Vim RPM package for Fedora.

To set this up quickly run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -cqO- https://git.io/vS5Ng)"
```

or:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -sL https://git.io/vS5Ng)"
```
